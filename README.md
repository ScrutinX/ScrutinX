🗳️ ScrutinX


🔍 Project Overview
ScrutinX is an innovative decentralized voting platform built on the Polygon blockchain, designed to empower communities with transparent and trustless governance. Our platform combines cutting-edge blockchain technology with user-friendly features to facilitate seamless, gasless voting accessible to all.

Key capabilities include:

Gasless Voting: Voters cast ballots without paying gas fees through meta-transactions relayed by a trusted bot wallet, making participation effortless and affordable.

Merkle-Proof Whitelisting: Robust and scalable voter eligibility verification ensures only authorized participants can vote, enhancing security and integrity.

DAO Integration: Community members govern platform policies and upgrades, ensuring truly decentralized decision-making.

Privacy-Preserving Voting: Leveraging zk-SNARKs technology (under active research) to enable anonymous and private voting while maintaining transparency.

Token Staking and Rewards: The native $SCX token incentivizes participation with staking programs and rewards aligned with governance contributions.
