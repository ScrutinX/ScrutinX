🗳️ ScrutinX: Decentralized, Transparent & Gasless Voting
📌 Abstract
ScrutinX is a decentralized, gasless voting platform designed to revolutionize governance through secure, transparent, and verifiable elections on the blockchain. Built on the Polygon network, ScrutinX integrates Merkle tree-based whitelisting, meta-transactions for gasless participation, DAO control, and future support for zk-SNARKs for privacy-preserving voting.

🎯 Vision
To build the most transparent, secure, and accessible digital voting system—empowering individuals, DAOs, organizations, and institutions to make trustless, decentralized decisions.

🧱 Core Features
✅ Merkle Whitelisting
Only authorized voters can participate by proving their eligibility via cryptographic Merkle proofs.

⚡ Gasless Voting via Relayer
Participants can vote without paying gas, enabled through meta-transactions and a relayer bot wallet.

🛡️ DAO Governance (Q4 2025)
All poll creations, updates, and rule modifications will eventually be controlled by token holders through a DAO structure.

🔐 Privacy (Coming Soon)
zk-SNARK-based private voting will allow votes to be cast anonymously while preserving result verifiability.

💸 Token Utility ($SCX)
The native token, $SCX, will power staking, rewards, DAO voting rights, and relayer reimbursements.

🔗 System Architecture
Smart Contracts: Deployed on Polygon (EVM compatible)

Relayer Bot: Signs and submits votes on behalf of users

Merkle Tree: Whitelist root stored on-chain; proofs verified per vote

Frontend: React + Web3.js for wallet connectivity and real-time UI

Metadata Storage: IPFS used for off-chain poll descriptions and candidate details

🧪 Voting Flow
Owner/DAO creates a poll with parameters (title, start/end time, max voters)

Merkle root of eligible voters is added

Voter signs message off-chain

Relayer submits meta-transaction to vote on-chain

Smart contract verifies signature and Merkle proof

Vote is recorded; events emitted for frontend sync

🔐 Security Considerations
Reentrancy protection

Signature replay attack prevention

Owner access control

Gas efficiency and capped voting slots

Auditing by third-party security firm scheduled for Q3 2025.

🗓️ Roadmap
Quarter	Milestone
Q2 2025	Smart contract dev, internal testing, relayer logic ✅
Q3 2025	Frontend launch, security audit, website & GitHub docs release 🔜
Q4 2025	DAO integration, $SCX token release, zk-voting R&D 🔜



$SCX will be launched as a utility token for ecosystem access, governance, and staking incentives.
